## 🏁 Introduction
This knowledge base was created to organize and summarize all topics discussed in IAS1.  
The goal is to understand how to protect information, manage security risks, and apply information assurance principles in real-life systems.

## 📚 Main Topics

### 🔹 1. Information Assurance and Security Overview
**Definition:**  
Information Assurance and Security (IAS) is the practice of protecting information systems against unauthorized access, attacks, or damage.

**Importance:**  
IAS ensures that data remains confidential, accurate, and available to authorized users.

---

### 🔹 2. CIA Triad
**Confidentiality:** Keeping information private using passwords or encryption.  
**Integrity:** Making sure data is accurate and unchanged.  
**Availability:** Ensuring systems and data are always accessible.

💡 **Example:**  
In online banking, encryption keeps your password private (confidentiality), transaction records must stay correct (integrity), and the website should always be up (availability).

---

### 🔹 3. Threats and Vulnerabilities
**Threats:** Possible dangers like hackers, malware, or phishing attacks.  
**Vulnerabilities:** Weaknesses in a system that can be exploited, like using weak passwords.

💭 **Example:** Clicking on a fake email link can lead to stolen passwords.

---

### 🔹 4. Encryption
**Definition:** Encryption converts readable data into unreadable code to protect information.

**Types:**  
- Symmetric Encryption: Same key for encrypting and decrypting.  
- Asymmetric Encryption: Uses a public key (shared) and private key (kept secret).

🗝️ **Analogy:** A public key is like a padlock anyone can close, but only you have the private key to open it.

---

### 🔹 5. Authentication and Access Control
**Authentication:** Verifying who you are (example: password, biometrics).  
**Access Control:** Deciding what you’re allowed to do after logging in.

🧩 **Example:**  
When you log in to Facebook, authentication checks your identity, and access control limits what pages you can manage.

---

### 🔹 6. Network Security
Protects data while being transferred over a network.

**Techniques:**  
- Firewalls  
- VPN  
- Secure connections (HTTPS)  
- Intrusion detection systems

🎯 **Goal:** To prevent unauthorized access or data theft during communication.

---

### 🔹 7. Security Policies and Procedures
Rules that guide users in handling and protecting information.

**Examples:**  
- Don’t share passwords.  
- Lock your computer when not in use.  
- Use antivirus software and update regularly.

---

### 🔹 8. Ethical and Legal Issues
IAS also focuses on ethical behavior and following data protection laws.

**Example:**  
The *Data Privacy Act of 2012* (Philippines) protects personal information from misuse.
